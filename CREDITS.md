A lot of the scripts and patches in this repo are based of the Linux From Scratch project (linuxfromscratch.org).  I sometimes give credit in individual scripts for specific things, but this is giving them credit repo wide.  

Another chunk is based on the archlinux PKGBUILD's  

And another big chunk, including packaging and a lot of the update fixes and patches come from me.
