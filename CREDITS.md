A lot of the scripts and patches in this repo are based of the Linux From Scratch project (linuxfromscratch.org).  I sometimes give credit in individual scripts for specific things, but this is giving them credit repo wide.  

Arch PKGBUILDS for Instructions
Fedora Rawhide for Patches
LFS for make-ca and other SSL utilties (As well as a lot of build instructions)


And another big chunk, including packaging and a lot of the update fixes and patches come from me.

And obviosuly credit to everyone who made these programs in the first place, Linux on the desktop would not be possible without you!
