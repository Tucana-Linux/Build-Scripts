# Complete toolchain rebuild (when glibc updates)
# You must have a 32 bit compiler on the system BEFORE starting, meaning Tucana 2.0 or higher


# Instructions for updating and frequency

# Linux API Headers - Rebuild just the toolchain, only update after glibc release or new change to the ABI
# Glibc - Rebuild the entire toolchain, push to unstable(weekly) branch, recompile all packages by the next full release.
# GCC - Updating only gcc should be fine

set -e
# Stage 1, preliminary builds, mostly for updating glibc
bash linux-api-headers
bash binutils-1
bash gcc-1
bash glibc-1
bash lib32-glibc-1

# Stage 2 fully featured compiler and libraries, some are built a 3rd time to include even more features
# Build GCC Depends again (not really needed but whatever)
bash gmp
bash mpfr
bash mpc
bash binutils-2
bash gcc-2
bash glibc-2
bash lib32-glibc-2

# Stage 3, rebuild GCC with more compilers and optimizations
bash gcc-3
